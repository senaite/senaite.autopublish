About
=====

This package enables the automatic and asynchronous publishing of results
reports, emailing included. User can choose multiple Samples in verified status
from samples listing and press the button "Auto publish" at the bottom of the
list. A confirmation is displayed and once the "Confirm" button is pressed, the
system delegates the publication process of the selected samples to
`senaite.queue`. This allows the sequential publication of large amounts of
samples in background, with just one click and with minimum impact on site
performance.

Installation
============

`senaite.autopublish` makes use of `Selenium WebDriver <https://selenium.dev/>`_,
a well-known tool used for browser testing automation: therefore, the
`selenium python package <https://pypi.org/project/selenium/>`_ , that provides
python language bindings for Selenium WebDriver, is automatically installed
after running bin/buildout with the egg `senaite.autopublish`.

Selenium WebDriver supports several browser drivers, but only
`chromedriver <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started>`_
is supported by `senaite.autopublish`. After running bin/buildout, you still
need to install the chrome browser and the chrome browser driver. Refer to
`versions selection documentation <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads/version-selection>`_
for further details.

Although `senaite.autopublish` runs the browser in headless mode, you need to
have a graphical interface in place in your system. Since your SENAITE instance
is probably running in a server without graphical interface, we suggest to
install `xvfb <https://linux.die.net/man/1/xvfb>`_ , a virtual framebuffer X
server.

Remember that `senaite.autopublish` depends on `senaite.queue` and the latter
has to be properly configured too. Please, check the usage and configuration
instructions provided in `senaite.queue repository <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.queue>`_.
